  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>On the Home Page is one big button.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>On Launch/Resume/Tap</strong><br>
      When Passenger first launches, when it resumes after 
      having been hidden, or when you click the button it will determine your
      phone's current position, and let you know it there 
      is any dangerous weather ahead or in your immediate 
      area that you need to worry about. This will also happen 
      when you go back to the Home Page from the About Page, 
      or when you re-open the app when it has been hidden.
